            <p>Food insecurity is at an all time high for Americans, espeically because of the pandemic. We'd like to alleviate some of the challenges posed by the pandemic by providing a portal, using which they can search for specific items that they need.</p>
            <p>Charitable donors may also use this website to assist their local food banks. By being able to see what goods the location needs, donors will be sure their donated goods are going to those who need it most.</p>
            <p>Users may set up accounts, that way their donations can be tracked over time for tax purposes, or donors can temporarily sign in as a guest if they plan on making a one time donation.</p>
